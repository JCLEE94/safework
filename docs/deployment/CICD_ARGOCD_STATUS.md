# CI/CD ArgoCD Pipeline Status Report

**Date**: 2025-01-13  
**Status**: ❌ Pipeline Failing - Registry Authentication Required

## Executive Summary

The SafeWork CI/CD pipeline is failing at the Docker registry push stage due to missing GitHub secrets for authentication. Tests are passing successfully, but images cannot be pushed to registry.jclee.me without proper credentials.

## Current Pipeline Status

| Stage | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Backend Unit Tests | ✅ Passing | 53 seconds |
| Backend Integration Tests | ✅ Passing | 53 seconds |
| Frontend Tests | ✅ Passing | 44 seconds |
| Docker Build | ✅ Successful | Image builds correctly |
| Registry Login | ❌ Failing | 401 Unauthorized |
| Docker Push | ❌ Not Reached | Blocked by login failure |
| ArgoCD Deployment | ❌ Not Reached | No images to deploy |

## Root Cause

The registry.jclee.me requires authentication, but the GitHub repository is missing the required secrets:
- `REGISTRY_USERNAME`
- `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`

## Required Actions

### 1. Add GitHub Secrets (URGENT)

Navigate to: https://github.com/JCLEE94/safework/settings/secrets/actions

Add the following secrets:
```
REGISTRY_USERNAME = qws9411
REGISTRY_PASSWORD = bingogo1
```

### 2. Verify Registry Access

After adding secrets, trigger a new pipeline run:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: verify registry authentication" && git push
```

### 3. Monitor Deployment

Once images are pushed successfully:
1. Check ArgoCD Image Updater logs:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n argocd deployment/argocd-image-updater -f
   ```
2. Verify deployment at: https://safework.jclee.me

## Recent Fixes Applied

1. **Docker buildcache authentication issue** (2025-01-13)
   - Implemented smart fallback strategy with `continue-on-error`
   - Prevents pipeline failure on cache miss

2. **Frontend build missing dev dependencies** (2025-01-13)
   - Changed from `npm ci --only=production` to `npm ci`
   - Dev dependencies required for Vite build process

3. **Registry authentication added** (2025-01-13)
   - Added docker login step to workflow
   - Configured to use GitHub secrets

## Technical Details

### Pipeline Configuration
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy-optimized.yml`
- **Registry**: registry.jclee.me
- **Image Pattern**: `prod-YYYYMMDD-SHA7`
- **Semantic Version**: `1.YYYYMMDD.BUILD_NUMBER`

### Error Log
```
Error response from daemon: login attempt to https://registry.jclee.me/v2/ failed with status: 401 Unauthorized
```

### Registry Status
- v2 API endpoint: ✅ Accessible
- Catalog endpoint: ✅ Returns repository list
- safework repository: ❌ Not yet created (will be created on first push)

## Next Steps Timeline

1. **Immediate** (Today):
   - Add GitHub secrets for registry authentication
   - Trigger test pipeline to verify authentication

2. **Short-term** (This Week):
   - Verify ArgoCD Image Updater detects new images
   - Confirm automatic deployment to production
   - Update documentation to reflect authentication requirement

3. **Long-term** (Next Sprint):
   - Consider migrating to a truly public registry if authentication issues persist
   - Implement secret rotation policy
   - Add monitoring for registry health

## Conclusion

The CI/CD pipeline is 90% functional with all tests passing. The only blocker is the missing GitHub secrets for Docker registry authentication. Once these secrets are added, the pipeline should complete successfully and trigger automatic deployments via ArgoCD Image Updater.
