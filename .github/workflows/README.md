# GitHub Actions Workflows

## üöÄ Active Workflows

### main-cicd.yml (Primary CI/CD Pipeline)
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch, manual dispatch
- **Purpose**: Build and push Docker images to registry
- **Features**:
  - Docker image build and push
  - Registry authentication
  - Build status reporting
  - Automatic failure tracking

### cicd-failure-tracker.yml (Failure Monitoring)
- **Trigger**: When any CI/CD workflow fails
- **Purpose**: Automatically create GitHub issues for CI/CD failures
- **Features**:
  - Failure detection across all workflows
  - Error log extraction and parsing
  - Duplicate issue prevention (24-hour window)
  - Automatic issue assignment to committer
  - Recurring failure tracking via comments

### build-deploy.yml
- **Trigger**: Push to `develop` branch
- **Purpose**: Development deployment using Watchtower
- **Target**: Development environment

### test.yml
- **Trigger**: All pushes and PRs
- **Purpose**: Run test suite only

### security.yml
- **Trigger**: Weekly schedule
- **Purpose**: Regular security vulnerability scanning

## üìÅ Deprecated/Disabled Workflows

These workflows have been disabled to prevent conflicts:

- **argocd-simple.yml**: Replaced by main-deploy.yml
- **k8s-deploy.yml**: Replaced by main-deploy.yml
- **docker-build.yml**: Legacy build workflow
- **deploy-hosted.yml**: Old deployment method
- **direct-deploy.yml**: Manual deployment (backup only)

## üîß Workflow Management

### To Re-enable a Workflow
Change the trigger from:
```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  # Disabled - replaced by main-deploy.yml
```

To:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
```

### Environment Variables Required

#### Registry Secrets
- `REGISTRY_USERNAME` (default: qws9411)
- `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` (default: bingogo1)

#### Deployment Secrets
- `KUBECONFIG`: Base64 encoded kubeconfig for K8s access
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: For updating manifests

## üìä Deployment Flow

```
1. Code Push (main) ‚Üí 2. Tests & Security Scan ‚Üí 3. Build & Push Image
                                                            ‚Üì
6. Verify Health ‚Üê 5. ArgoCD Auto-sync ‚Üê 4. Update K8s Manifests
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Image Tagging Strategy

- **Production**: `prod-YYYYMMDD-SHA7` (e.g., prod-20250104-abc1234)
- **Development**: `dev-YYYYMMDD-SHA7`
- **Latest**: Always points to the most recent production build

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### Via ArgoCD UI
1. Navigate to https://argo.jclee.me/applications/safework
2. Click "History and Rollback"
3. Select previous version
4. Click "Rollback"

### Via CLI
```bash
argocd app rollback safework --server argo.jclee.me
```

## üö® CI/CD Failure Tracking

When a CI/CD workflow fails:

1. **Automatic Issue Creation**
   - Title: `[CI/CD Failure] {Workflow Name} - {Branch}`
   - Labels: `ci/cd`, `bug`, `automated`
   - Assignee: Person who triggered the workflow
   - Content: Error logs, workflow details, and suggested actions

2. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Checks for similar issues created within 24 hours
   - If found, adds a comment instead of creating new issue
   - Tracks recurring failures

3. **Error Log Collection**
   - Extracts last 50 error/failure/exception messages
   - Links to full workflow run
   - Provides troubleshooting suggestions

## üìù Notes

- All workflows use self-hosted runners for better performance
- Test containers use ports 15432 (PostgreSQL) and 16379 (Redis)
- Production URL: https://safework.jclee.me
- ArgoCD Dashboard: https://argo.jclee.me
- CI/CD failures are automatically tracked via GitHub Issues
