# Modular Frontend Architecture

## ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Component Structure

### **Major Optimization Achievement**: App.tsx Reduction
- **Before**: 5,156 lines (monolithic structure)
- **After**: 110 lines (98% reduction through modularization)

### **Component Organization**
```
src/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard/          # Main dashboard with metrics cards
â”œâ”€â”€ Workers/           # Worker management module
â”œâ”€â”€ HealthExams/       # Health examination module
â”œâ”€â”€ WorkEnvironments/  # Work environment monitoring
â”œâ”€â”€ HealthEducation/   # Education tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ ChemicalSubstances/# MSDS management
â”œâ”€â”€ AccidentReports/   # Accident reporting
â”œâ”€â”€ Documents/         # PDF form generation
â””â”€â”€ shared/           # Reusable components
```

### **Key Design Patterns**

#### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Each domain has its own component module
- Shared UI components extracted to `/shared`
- Business logic separated from presentation

#### 2. **Modern React Patterns**
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for API calls and state management
- **Context**: Global state for user session and settings
- **Suspense**: Loading states and error boundaries
- **React Query**: Server state management and caching

#### 3. **TypeScript Integration**
- Full type safety across components
- Interface definitions in `src/types/`
- Enum definitions in `src/constants/`

## ðŸ”„ State Management Strategy

### **Server State** (React Query)
- API data caching and synchronization
- Background refetching
- Optimistic updates

### **Client State** (React Context + useState)
- UI state (modals, forms, filters)
- User preferences
- Navigation state

### **Form State** (React Hook Form)
- Validation with Zod schemas
- Error handling
- Submit optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ Performance Optimizations

### **React Optimizations**
- Memoization with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- Component lazy loading
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Debounced search inputs

### **Bundle Optimization** 
- Vite for fast builds and HMR
- Code splitting by route/feature
- Tree shaking of unused code
- Optimized asset compression
